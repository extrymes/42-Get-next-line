# 42-Get-next-line
## Overview
The **get_next_line** project from the **42 School** involves implementing a **function to read a file line by line**. The goal of the project is to develop an efficient, memory-safe method for handling input from a file descriptor and returning each line until the end of the file. This project is designed to reinforce the concepts of file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and buffer management in C.

## Getting started
There is no excutable for this project, you just need to make and use the function in your code.
> If you are on macOS, make sure you have installed **Xcode Command Line Tools**.
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/extrymes/42-Get-next-line.git
cd 42-Get-next-line
```
2. Include the header file in your code
```c
#include "path/to/get_next_line.h"
```
3. Make and add the C files to your program compilation
```bash
make
cc <file.c> get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
You can compile `get_next_line_tests.c` to test the function.
